# React + Jumpsuit + Webpack2 Starter Kit

This is a fork of [Budgeting](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/budgeting-sample-app-webpack2), adjusted to my taste.

## Contains

- [x] [Webpack 2.2](https://webpack.github.io)
- [x] [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [x] [Jumpsuit](https://jumpsuit.js.org/)
- [x] [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

Make sure you have the latest node before using Webpack 2. Some depenencies my fail in older versions.

**Update 01/23/2017:** Bumped to Webpack 2.2 and React 15.4.2 with updates to webpack and babel config. Webpack's performance hints are on for production (`npm run prod`)
